DSLauncher.net
==============

A .net Game Launcher for the Dungeon and Shotguns
Gaming community. Mostly used for running and updating
the Client for the DS Minecraft.

If you would like to use any of this code to build your 
own launcher feel free. I will warn you that the code in
this project is not the best. A lot of clean up needs to
be done.

Some sections of this code where taken from other projects
on GitHub:
